Soldering
=========
All referenced names are from blender/glove/glove.blend

- solder `gnd wire thumb finger`, `vcc wire thumb finger`
  and `servo wire thumb finger` to `pot thumb finger`
- solder `gnd wire index finger`, `vcc wire index finger`
  and `servo wire index finger` to `pot index finger`
- solder `gnd wire middle finger`, `vcc wire middle finger`
  and `servo wire middle finger` to `pot middle finger`
- pass the thumb wires through the thumb hole, `pot thumb finger` should be in
  the final position at the end
- pass the `servo wire thumb finger` through the wire exit hole
- pass the index finger wires through the index holes, `pot index finger` should 
  be in the final position at the end
- pass the `servo wire index finger` through the wire exit hole
- pass the middle finger wires through the thumb hole, `pot middle finger should 
- pass the `servo wire thumb finger` through the wire exit hole
- pass the `vcc wire exit` and the `gnd wire exit` through the wire exit hole
- interweave `gnd wire thumb finger`, `gnd wire index finger`,
  `gnd wire middle finger`, `gnd wire exit` and solder to get `gnd solder joint`
- interweave `vcc wire thumb finger`, `vcc wire index finger`,
  `vcc wire middle finger`, `vcc wire exit` and solder to get `vcc solder joint`
- ensure `gnd solder joint` and `vcc solder joint` don't touch

Glueing
=======
- test glove potentiometer readings using arduino/glove_read_test.ino
- screw in `index finger`
- glue and screw in `middle finger`
- glue and screw in `thumb finger`
- glue glove protection

Sowing
======
- sow the fingers to the glove using instructions from `sowing the glove.png`
  (black lines mean needle over texture, while lines mean needle under texture)
